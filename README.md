# Emurgo ethereum project : A proposal to improve commitment in a community
# A proposal to improve commitment in a community


A community need a strong commitment from its member in order to grow.  
For example, coming to community meetings, participating to overall projects ...

Most of the time, commitment of members are very different : same and few people are coming to the events organised by the community
Thus, the aim of this proposal is to enhance a commitment behaviour in order to make more collaboration in a community.

## Some definition
### Community 
In this context, a community is defined as : 
* finding interesting mission for its member. 
* putting in place a context where their member can grow
* asking people to help the community to grow

### Members
A member is participating in the community. 

### Events
An event is a period of time, organised by the community where members come to exchange, communicate, create and make some proposals.

### Commitment
Commitment is a behaviour that help the community to grow. 
It is the responsibility of a member to deal with the intensity of his commitment.


## Proposal
Thanks to smart contract, goal is to create a protocol where
* Community grows by its members activity and proposals
* Members are motivated to plug&play through the community. 
Because a commitment is a wanted behaviour, it is rewarded by the community and can open new positions for its committed members

### Rules
#### Members
A Member is expected to commit his commitment to become a committed member, then he is available for receiving rewards
* He commits to come and give value to a number of events he decides
* At the end of its commitment, he will receive rewards based on the percentage of event he came
A member can also receive bonuses
* Reward bonus is based on number of events he commits to come
* He must have completed his commitment in sequence to receive is bonus

#### Contract
Contract is enabled when
* A minimum of members are required to stack their commitment for a minimum of sessions 

For a given event, rewards are enabled when :    
* A minimum of committed members are coming for a given event
Rewards are calculated based on
* A number of members expected to come
* Quality of the event, evaluated by members coming to the event
* The number of members (committed or not) who came to the event

### Technically
Commitment is a ERC20 utility token with a given supply.
